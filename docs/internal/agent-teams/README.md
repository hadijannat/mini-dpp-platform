# Agent Teams Docs

This directory contains the repository's canonical guidance for running multi-agent workflows with Claude Code.

## Included Guides

- [Claude Code Agent Teams Technical Reference](./claude-code-agent-teams-reference.md)
- [AAS/DPP Inspection Squad Playbook](./aas-dpp-inspection-squad-playbook.md)
- [OpenClaw-Style Swarm Playbook (Codex + Claude)](./openclaw-codex-claude-swarm-playbook.md)

## Recommended Use

1. Read the technical reference first to understand Task subagents vs Agent Teams.
2. Use the inspection squad playbook when you need a structured 8+1 role audit of the IDTA template pipeline.
3. Keep findings in `docs/internal/audits/` using the existing register/matrix/epic artifacts.

## Scope Boundary

These documents are workflow and coordination guidance only. They do not define runtime backend/frontend behavior.

## Versioning Note

This guidance is maintained as of **2026-02-09** and should be re-validated when Claude Code agent-team capabilities change.
